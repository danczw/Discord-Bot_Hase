**Hase** is a feature-rich Discord bot built using Python programming language. It offers various functionalities to enhance the user experience within a Discord server. From basic user commands to fun interactions, Hase aims to bring joy and utility to your server members. üê∞ The bot leverages the power of generative AI to provide image generation capabilities, making it even more intriguing to chat with.

It also helps server owners to manage their servers by providing notifications when a new user joins or leaves the server. The bot also greets new users with a private message (PM) to make them feel welcome.

## Event handlers

Hase comes with event handlers that react to certain actions within the server:

- *on_ready:* Notifies the bot owner when the bot is ready to use.
- *on_member_join:* Greets new users with a private message and notifies the server owner when someone joins the server.
- *on_member_remove:* Notifies the server owner when a user leaves the server.

## Development environment setup

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for handling dependencies. To set up the development environment:

- create virtual virtual environment using `pyproject.toml` via `uv sync`
- create `.env` file with your personal discord bot token (refer to `.env.example`) and [invite the bot to your server](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html)
- update further secrets in `.env` file, such as bot owner ID and guild ID (i.e. server ID)
- run `uv run src/main.py`

SQLite is used to store message history for chat. The database and relevant tables are created on start up if not existent and are located in `data/chat.db`. This allows for a persistent chat history and a more natural conversation flow, as the context is retainable for the model. The number of messages used as context while generating a chat response can be configured in `conf/config.yaml`.

Logging is configured to write to `logs/discord.log` for debugging purposes. Dependencies can be found in `pyproject.toml`. For local development, secrets can be set in the `.env` file. Configuration options are available in `conf/config.yaml`.
